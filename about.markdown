I have a passion for leveraging AI to make developers' lives better -- especially API developers and consumers -- one API at a time, one organization at a time.

### Projects:

 - [Resume ChatBot](https://resumebot.tmaguire.net): A chatbot I built to help prospective employers learn more about me without the limitations of a traditional resume.  It's difficult to know exactly what a company wants to see on a resume so why not give them an interface to ask whatever question they want.  This project highlights my Gen AI fluency and technical prowess.  A typescript project built with Lovable.dev and using Supabase as its storage.  It calls OpenAI's 4o model for the question and response.</p>
