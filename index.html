<h3>Platform Engineering Series</h3>
<p>A series  started as part of the #APIFutures project.  I was struggling to think of topics to write about, and since I am looking for a job, I wanted to write about a topic that aligns with what I'm looking for in my next role.  This series is meant to give an intoduction to Platform Enginering, how it helps with an API program, and also show off my knowledge of APIs and Platform Engineering.</p>
