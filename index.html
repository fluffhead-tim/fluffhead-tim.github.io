<h3>Platform Engineering Series</h3>
<p>A series I started as part of the #APIFutures project.  As I was brainstorming ideas, I was doing a lot of reading on how a Platform Engineering program can improve an organization's software delivery.  The more I read and took notes, I started to compile these into a series of essays.  The first of which I'm publishing to coincide with the #APIFutures project.  This series is meant to give an introduction to Platform Engineering, how it helps with an API program, and also show off my knowledge of APIs and Platform Engineering.</p>
