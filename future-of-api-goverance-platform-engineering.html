<h1>The Future of API Governance is based on Platform Engineering</h1>
<h2>Jan 11, 2024</h2>

<p>APIs are fundamental building blocks that facilitate seamless communication and data exchange between various software applications and services. They have revolutionized how developers create, deploy, and integrate software, making them a critical element in any organization. As these ecosystems become more complex, the need for a structured API design and development approach becomes increasingly vital each year.  With this explosion of APIs, it’s vital to reign in the API sprawl, where APIs grow organically with different implementations.  This leads to inconsistent APIs and increases the risk of security flaws in your APIs.</p>
    
    <p>Building an API Platform Engineering program is a strategic set of practices and patterns aimed at streamlining enterprise software delivery via designing, developing, testing, and maintaining an organization's scalable ecosystem of APIs.  These initiatives originated at companies like Google and Netflix with enormous developer teams, by providing an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) for developers that manage infrastructure, such as K8s, enabling more self-service so developers can focus on building applications that directly deliver business value.  It’s sometimes called a “Paved Road,” meaning the platform engineering team provides a paved road for developers to deliver business value quickly via software and applications.  A well-designed IDP will improve the overall developer experience for internal and external stakeholders by reducing friction, frustration, and cognitive load, ultimately leading to more predictable software delivery. </p>
    
    
   <h2> What is Platform Engineering </h2>
    
   <p>API Platform Engineering encompasses the systematic design, development, deployment, and maintenance of an organization's API ecosystem, including (Internal Developer Portal) IDPs, toolchains, and workflows. These capabilities support the self-service creation and consumption of APIs by various stakeholders, including developers, partners, and internal teams. 
    
    <p> When building the API Platform, we’ll keep four fundamental principles in mind:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Self-Service Empowerment</li>
    <li>Focus on Developer Experience (DevEX)  </li>
    <li>Adopt a Product Mindset</li>
    <li>Constant monitoring and feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>These four principles allow for the paved road to developer happiness and better software delivery outcomes.</p>
    
    <p>Developers like solving HARD problems. However, routine tasks such as finding documentation and knowing if that documentation is up to date or figuring out the proper configuration of a K8s cluster should not be “hard” problems.  When these tasks become “hard,” developer fatigue and burnout lead to lower-quality APIs, inefficient processes, churn, and security exposure.  We aim to improve the developer experience by providing the tools developers need to reduce this friction and additional cognitive load on the developer.</p>
    
        <p>However, setting up an API platform comes with its challenges. we must:</p>
        <ul>
    <li>balance openness and security </li>
    <li>ensure scalability to accommodate increasing API usage while versioning APIs and ensuring backward compatibility</li>
    <li>maintain consistency across APIs via governance and documentation to avoid confusion</ul>
    
    <p>This series aims to provide a detailed exploration of API Platform Engineering.  Along the way, we’ll:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Build an API Platform Maturity Model, which can be used to benchmark your organization </li>
    <li>how to get started on the platform engineering journey, starting with building the business</li>
    <li>Review team topologies </li>
    <li>Develop and prioritize a roadmap for implementation, </li>
    <li>Finish with monitoring and gathering feedback for future iterations.  </li>
    <li>Review case studies of successful and unsuccessful implementations</li>
    </ul>

    
   <p> By the end of this series, you should understand what goes into a successful IDP, providing valuable insights into its components, best practices, and the path to successful implementation paving the way for a best in class API program.</p>
