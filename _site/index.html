        </h3><p>In retail, product categorization is crucial. It directly impacts discoverability, conversion, and compliance by driving the required attributes in search facets. While rule-based systems might work in some verticals, marketplace taxonomies differ significantly, mappings drift over time, and edge cases multiply rapidly.</p>

        </h3><p>I was working with a client who had  35,000+ individual SKUs in their inventory catalog, and they wanted to automate publishing these products to about 8-10 different online marketplaces. Today it’s a laborious manual process involving spreadsheets and lots of copying and pasting of the same fields over and over.</p>

        </h3><p>I use AI tools daily for everything from web searches to finding recipes to prototyping APIs. While powerful, these tools often require repeating the same context multiple times for similar tasks. This is where Custom GPTs in ChatGPT excel. These specialized AI assistants are trained on custom instructions and knowledge for specific tasks. Their purpose is to create focused, task-specific versions of ChatGPT that include:</p>

            API Versioning
          </a>
        </h3><p>As a product manager for SaaS applications, making platform updates is relatively straightforward. Features can be rolled out gradually using feature flags to ensure proper adoption and quality, and aspects like migration and versioning typically aren’t required. While SaaS documentation needs updating, it’s not as critical as updating developer documentation for API changes. In this article, I’ll provide a framework for versioning an API and sharing experiences of what has and hasn’t worked for me.</p>

        </h3><p>I recently had an interesting discussion with some colleagues at a networking event about the differences in the roles and responsibilities of the product management function across organizations.  In many organizations, the product team is seen as a jack of all trades and fills gaps between other teams within the organization.  In a startup, this is usually acceptable and expected; however, as an organization scales, it is best to clearly delineate product-building functions.</p>

        </h3><p>A while back, I was chatting with a colleague who had just had their first baby.  At the same time, my oldest was a couple of weeks away from high school graduation and about to leave for college.  We started riffing on how parenting aligns with the Product Life Cycle (PLC). The job is the same; however, the needs, support, and management of a child differ as they grow older, similar to a product.  Here’s an attempt to compare the similarities throughout the PLC stages.</p>

However as teams and companies made the transition from in-office to remote and back or to a hybrid situation, we’ve continued to hold on to our old habits from when we all worked in the office.</p>

  <p><em>When brainstorming topics for the <a href="https://matthewreinbold.github.io/APIFutures/index.html">APIFutures</a> initiative, one theme that stood out was Platform Engineering and its benefits to an organization.  I kept reading and listening to podcasts on how Platform Engineering and DORA metrics streamline software development and delivery.  As I took notes and learned more about this topic, I decided to roll this into the API Futures project and start a series on how Platform Engineering streamlines API management and governance.  This first post introduces the problems a Platform Engineering team can solve and provides a sneak peek of the series.  Hope you enjoy this post and return for the rest of the series. I look forward to feedback to keep the discussion going.</em></p>
